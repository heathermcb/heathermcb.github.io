## Overview 

My research group exists to:

1. conduct research at the intersection of information and statistical sciences; 
2. bring together researchers and practitioners from various academic disciplines and industry; and
3. provide high-quality training opportunities for students.

We organize the Toronto Data Workshop, which everyone is welcome to attend - sign up [here](https://forms.gle/sXbEixoa1iJR4Q7A8). We also maintain an internal reading group and presentation schedule.


## People 

### Faculty affiliates

- [Kelly Lyons](http://individual.utoronto.ca/klyons/).
- [Samantha-Jo Caetano](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/people/directories/all-faculty/samantha-jo-caetano).

### Industry affiliates

- [Sharla Gelfand](https://sharla.party/).
- [Hareem Naveed](https://github.com/harnav).

### Students

Students are equal partners, have considerable autonomy, are given co-authorship, and are paid. They take ownership of their project and contribute critically to its success.

#### Current

- **Ciara Zogheib** is a PhD candidate in the Faculty of Information at the University of Toronto. 
- **Lindsay Katz** recently graduated with a masters in statistics from the department of statistical sciences at the University of Toronto. 

#### Past

- **A Mahfouz** worked with me as a Master of Information student at the University of Toronto with a background in geography. Their prior work has been largely concerned with data pipelines. A contributed to many projects including: 1) [`heapsofpapers`](https://rohanalexander.github.io/heapsofpapers/) which is an R package that makes it easier to respectfully download files from the internet. 2) 'Discussions of bias in AI/ML research': In this paper we gather a sample of recent AI/ML research and use natural language processing to understand the extent to which bias, in an ethical rather than statistical sense, is considered. 3) 'Communicating geographically-based Bayesian models': In this paper we introduce a method to communicate the geographic results of Bayesian models. 
- **Amy Farrow** is a Master of Information student at the University of Toronto. 
- **Annie Collins** is an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto specializing in applied mathematics and statistics with a minor in history and philosophy of science. Annie worked on ['An Introduction to DoSStoolkit'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09347) and ['Reproducibility of COVID-19 pre-prints'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10724).
- **Ke-Li Chiu** is a Master of Information student at the University of Toronto interested in natural language processing. Ke-Li worked on: ['On consistency scores in text data with an implementation in R'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05225) and ['Detecting Hate Speech with GPT-3'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12407).
- **Paul Hodgetts** is a Master of Information student at the University of Toronto. Paul put together `cesR`, which is an R package that makes it easier to gather and use the Canadian Election Study surveys from 1965 through to 2019, described here: https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a29h8/. Work in progress involves estimates of stateless populations.




<!-- # FAQ -->

<!-- ### Current Toronto undergrad or masters students -->

<!-- If you are a Toronto undergrad or masters student and would like to work with me, then the best way is to do well in a course that I teach and then get in touch. That said, I do advertise for positions from time to time and you should also keep an eye out for those. Impressive applicants have: -->

<!-- 1) GitHub repos that show off their best work. -->
<!-- 2) Exceptional written communication skills. -->
<!-- 3) Support the claims they make in a cover letter with evidence. -->


<!-- ### Current Toronto PhD students -->

<!-- I am open to supervising PhD students. If you are already admitted, then please email me. -->

<!-- ### Prospective PhD students -->

<!-- If you are not yet a Toronto PhD student: -->

<!-- - Thank you for reaching out. Having gone through it myself, I do understand that grad school applications are stressful and there is a lot of conflicting advice. -->
<!-- - I am open to supervising PhD students, but can only help once you are admitted. Admission decisions are made at a department/faculty level and there is little I can do to help you until you're in. While I understand that practices differ across fields and universities, in my case, there is no point contacting me until you're admitted. -->

<!-- - Again, the first step is to apply and be admitted into the PhD program. In my case that likely means either [Information](https://ischool.utoronto.ca/future-students/apply/phd-apply/) or [Statistical Sciences](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/graduate/phd-application-information). -->
<!-- - As part of the application you'll have the option to list faculty with whom you would like to work, and you should certainly put my name down. -->
<!-- - Again, after you are admitted to the program I will have all the time in the world for you, but until then there's little that I can do because these decisions are made at a department/faculty level. -->


<!-- ### Reference letters -->

<!-- I can only provide reference letters to students that work with me or got an A+ in a course that I taught. This is because I only write reference letters that very strongly recommend you and I can only confidently strongly recommend you if you're in one of those two buckets.  -->

<!-- If I've worked with you or you got an A+ in a course that I taught then I'd be happy to write you references and I will need:  -->

<!-- 1) two weeks' notice;  -->
<!-- 2) a unofficial copy of your entire Toronto transcript;  -->
<!-- 3) a copy of your CV; -->
<!-- 4) a list of the marks that you got in the papers you wrote for me and a copy of those papers;  -->
<!-- 5) a list of the programs that you're applying for;  -->
<!-- 6) three or four paragraphs where you talk about yourself in third person (this is: 1) to ensure that I use the correct names, pronouns etc; 2) to better understand what role I play - am I the stats/information/other reference for you, am I the academic/work/etc reference; 3) to give me something to start from). -->

<!-- Finally, writing references is part of my job. There's not need to feel bad about asking, and there's no need for gifts - while I appreciate the gesture, it's not appropriate - a thank you email is more than sufficient (oh, and of course let me know if you get whatever it is you applied for. -->
